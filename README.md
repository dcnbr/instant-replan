# Visualizing A Planner's State Exploration 

December Stuart | Sal Choueib

## Structure

`fast-downward-22.12/` contains a modified version of the fast-downward planning 
system. Compilation and useage is as usual, but the planner will write two
additional files:
- `statespace.csv`, which will contain the SAS+ variables at each abstract state
- `relation.csv`, which will contain the state transition information

`classical-planning/` contains a number of classical planning settings

`visualize-replay/` contains the visualization script `replay.m`, as well as a
catalog of the data and figures presented in the report. To run do:
```
>> replay("state_space_file.csv", "state_translation.csv")
```
